	-Adjustments

	lightMap support (hoping they're working right)

	-Bug Fixes

	-Additions
	UV Scale options added for PBR Maps 1 and 2 (useful for tilling textures)

		- None
		- Linear
		- Filmic

1.05 (01/10/2023)
---------------------------------------
	-Adjustments
	Controller works like a normal one now, no need for remaking mats
	
	-Removals
	"Model_Darkness" in shader but still exists through controller
	
1.06 (01/10/2023)
---------------------------------------
	-Adjustments

	-Bug Fixes
	Gamma properly working now
	
1.07 (07/10/2023)
---------------------------------------
	-AdjustmentsD

1.08 (10/10/2023)
---------------------------------------
	-Adjustments
	readded original hgshadow with slight ediit to make shadow shading smoother
	
2.00 (11/02/2024)
---------------------------------------
	-Overhaul
	Versions before v2.00 are not compatible as v2.00 is a rewrite of the entire shader
	PBR and Non-PBR have been separated into their own shaders
	PBR has been redone and hopefully is more proper this time around

	-Additions
	Blendmodes options
	Culling options
	Zwrite option
	
	-Removals
	PMX Controller
	Some features from previous versions have been removed
	Fallback Shadows for when no HgShadow.x is loaded
	
	-Notes
	Removed Features that were in previous versions will be moved to specific shader variations that make use of them
	The PMX Controller will be rethought of what it should control or not, thought that all options in shader was too much for a controller
	Depending on feedback about the fallback shadows, if desired I'll consider bringing them back

	-Additions
	Project Diva X HD Variation Shader
